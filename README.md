# ⬡ ClusterNova - Customer Segmentation & Basket Analysis

Machine Learning II project developed by **Lucas Casemiro**, **Lourenço Lima**, and **Afonso Lince** (undergraduate students in Data Science at NOVA IMS).

This platform features a professional customer intelligence dashboard implementing:
* **Customer Segmentation**: Unsupervised K-Means clustering ($k=8$ using `RobustScaler` on demographic & behavioral features, combined with an isolated `Vegans` cluster, yielding **9 final segments**).
* **Market Basket Analysis**: decopled Apriori association rules mined per segment to support personalized campaigns and real-time checkout cross-selling.
* **Interactive Simulator**: A live simulator featuring customer lookups, promotions campaigns, evaluation scoring, and a shopping checkout simulator.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project (Como Executar o Projeto)

### Prerequisites (Pré-requisitos)
Make sure you have **Python 3.10+** and **Node.js (v18+)** installed.

---

### Step 1: Start the Flask Backend Server (Passo 1: Iniciar o Servidor Flask)
The backend manages real-time customer lookups, retrieves historical carts, and serves the mined association rules.

1. Open your terminal at the project root directory.
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   * **Windows (PowerShell)**:
     ```powershell
     .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   * **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install the dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
   *The server will start running on **`http://localhost:5000`**.*

---

### Step 2: Start the React Frontend Dashboard (Passo 2: Iniciar o Dashboard React)
The dashboard provides a visual, interactive interface to explore segment distributions, view clustering metrics, and run simulator actions.

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `dashboard/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   ```
2. Install the frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the Vite development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *Open your browser and navigate to the local link shown (typically **`http://localhost:5173`**).*

*(Optional)* Alternatively, you can preview the compiled production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

* `functions/`: Reusable Python helpers for preprocessing, clustering calculations, and visualizations.
* `data/`:
  * `ci_clustering.csv`: Raw cleaned customer dataset.
  * `ci_clustered.csv`: Clustered customer dataset containing K-Means labels (0 to 8).
  * `customer_basket.csv`: Recorded shopping cart transactions.
  * `cluster_association_rules.json`: Decoupled single-product Apriori association rules per cluster.
* `dashboard/`: React + Vite frontend source code.
